# Langi Django App

Langi is an application designed to help its users develop their language skills in a fun and convenient way. It uses one of the most popular SRS (Spaced Repetition System) algorithms for learning the previously created flashcards. Apart from adding new flashcards, users can import files to automatically create entire sets of words. The application supports both text document files and image files such as PNG and JPG. Featured mini-games, make learning new words and expressions entertaining. Langiâ€™s interface is available in 16 languages and 2 color modes - the default "light" mode, and the optional "dark" mode, which is particularly useful when using the application at night. Other functionalities include the system of virtual keyboards, the audio recording option (used to save the pronunciation of a new word), the auto-translation with Google Translate API and learning statistics. The application was created with Django technology, Django REST framework, and OpenCV-Python library.
